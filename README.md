## Initial Backend setup
1. Requires python 3.6+
2. Using a virtual environment is recommended (I think that pycharm does it for you). See https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/ to learn how to make your virtual enviorment and how to activate it.
3. Navigate to the backend folder
4. Run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` in order to install the required libraries.

## Runnig the Backend server
To run the backend server run the following command ```uvicorn main:app --reload```
